This is implementation of Conway's Game of Life that uses power of Lisp and OpenGl.
If you don't know what Game of Life is, please refer to wikipedia ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Conway's_Game_of_Life )

To launch it simply use following command 

sbcl-run run-gl.lisp

or enter lisp interpreter and load "run-gl.lisp" file 

This program is tested only with sbcl lisp implementation. 
You need to install additional libraries to make program work. 
Just try to execute program and you'll see what are missing ;)
